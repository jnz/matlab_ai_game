Simple game in MATLAB with AI
-----------------------------

Simple demo to train a neural network (NN) in Keras, let the resulting NN play the game in MATLAB.

This is a simple game, written in MATLAB (one should not try to create games in
MATLAB). This game can be played by a human to create training data (captured
as .csv). Or it can be played by an AI mode. The AI is trained, based on the .csv data
with Keras in Python. The trained network is exported as weight matrices and bias vectors
into MATLAB.

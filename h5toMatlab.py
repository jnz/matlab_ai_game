# This script will convert a Keras model saved in HDF5 format
# to a MATLAB script that can be used to test the model.
# The script will print the weights and biases for each layer
# but it is quite a bit taylored to the specific model I am
# using.  You will need to modify it to work with your model.

# You need to manually copy the output of this script into
# the MATLAB script: rlmain.m (function nnInit)
# Not the most elegant thing in the world, but I wanted to
# see how use a trained model outside of the Python environment.
